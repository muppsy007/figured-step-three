# Blog Application coding exercise

This coding exercise is is designed to help us figure out your level when it comes to our stack.

## The exercise

Please build a blog application where users can read posts and where an admin user can log in and create, update and delete posts.

### Requirements

Please use:
* MongoDB for storing the blog posts (storing user information in MySQL is fine)
* Vue.js for the front end

If you run out of time to do anything extra, you are welcome to put in your email what you would have done if you had some more time.
This should take a couple of days max, all we need is a link to the Git (or equivalent) once youâ€™re done.

***

#### Running the environment

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your commits, please don't squash them into the original repository commits, it makes it difficult to see your work.
3. Refer to the main readme for instructions on running the app.
